*Postgraduate(2024-Present):*

**LLM-Based Intelligent Companion AI Digital Humans with Consciousness and Memory**
<!-- This group project aims to create a robust Multi-Dimensional Cognitive Reliability and Security Framework for LLM-Based Companion Agents. By integrating advancements in cognitive reasoning, interpretability, security, and personalized emotional support, the project seeks to address the growing concerns over the reliability, transparency, and security of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven digital human companions. The overarching objective is to ensure that these agents can operate securely, reason effectively, adapt emotionally, and provide trustworthy, context-sensitive responses while safeguarding user privacy and maintaining resistance against adversarial manipulations. -->

**Project Summary:** Addressing challenges like prompt injection attacks, data leakage, low interpretability, and emotional deficiency in LLM companion agents for education/healthcare, developed a comprehensive framework to strengthen security, enhance reasoning, quantify uncertainties, and customize emotional support, aiming to create secure, reliable, and empathetic AI assistants. 

**Key Contributions** (Large-Scale Redbird Base Project - Focus on Reducing LLM Hallucinations and Aligning Model Output with Human Factors):
* Employed Apriori algorithm for association rule learning to mine latent relationships in dataset concept annotations, enhancing causal variable interpretability.
* Built a knowledge graph as a knowledge base to relax strong assumptions of non-recursive causal models.
<!-- * Designed an innovative Abductive Learning and Concept Bottleneck Model (ACBMs) framework, achieving SOTA results on CelebA (concept prediction accuracy +$0.2242 \pm 0.0576$, label accuracy +$0.3316 \pm 0.1203$). Ongoing work planned for AAAI 2026 submission. -->

**Backdoor Attack Defense for Concept Bottleneck Models**

**Project Summary:** In explainable AI (XAI), Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability via understandable underlying concepts, but are vulnerable to concept-level backdoor attacks (hidden triggers in concepts causing undetectable misbehavior). First proposed Conceptguard defense: constructed poisoned datasets, divided data subsets, and used majority voting to mitigate data-driven backdoor impacts.

**Key Contributions:**

<!-- * Theoretically proved a minimum trigger size threshold, above which Conceptguard effectively defends against attacks (average backdoor success rate reduced by ~30\%). -->

* Led CBMs baseline and Conceptguard experiments on CUB dataset, demonstrating improved concept accuracy. Identified cluster mechanism as an unsupervised method to avoid concept-level category conflicts and enhance feature learning for better concept correlation capture.

<!-- *Undergraduate(2020-2024):*

**Multidimensional evaluation model of driving safety based on big data of new energy bus operation**
  * China University of Petroleum Beijing 

  * Developed a new evaluation model for driving behavior based on vehicle status, real-time driving, and
 driving behavior using machine learning methods such as BPNN, SVM, CNN, KNN, and DTR.
   *  Processed 688 million data points from electrical vehicles, handled default values for key variables, and
 trained models for multiple season data sets.
