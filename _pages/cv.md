Research experience
======
**Multidimensional evaluation model of driving safety based on big data of new energy bus operation**
  <!-- * China University of Petroleum Beijing  -->

  * Developed a new evaluation model for driving behavior based on vehicle status, real-time driving, and
 driving behavior using machine learning methods such as BPNN, SVM, CNN, KNN, and DTR.
   *  Processed 688 million data points from electrical vehicles, handled default values for key variables, and
 trained models for multiple season data sets.

**A combined application of a gravity model and social network analysis evaluating the economic connections**

  * Analyzed the global trade network of waste and developed innovative ways to enhance decision-making
 through temporal exponential random graph models.
  * Constructed global waste trade networks and studied their structural evolution and determinants.
